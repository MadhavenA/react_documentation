1.responding To Event{
    * In this Topic we just learn about the how to handle the event and how to add the event Handler.
    * event handler was handle  own function to trigger the interaction while clicking , showing and function based works .
    * passing the function is the correct action .  call function is incorrect action.
    * () => this case would be used for the rendering the action immideatly.
    * naming EventHadler Props was always start with on  and its was start with capital letter .
    * naming Event handler can easily customize the name freely .
    * event Propagate was  catch the perticular or more event Wor with the help of divison tag .
    * stoping Propagate was used for stop the event object with the help of this key word it was also known as prevent the event bubbling further.
    * if using propagate to the perticular event it was called as capture phase event.
}
    2.State A Component Memory{
        * In this topic we just learn about how to change the form  include the perticular action with the help of useState
         ,how to update  the form and input fields and how to use useState in the reactjs.
         * using of use state hook provide two things retain the data => state variable,state setter function =>
          update the variable and triger the react component again.
          * In any other function word contains use means it will be known as hooks .
          * state is isolated and private it would not affect the same as otherComponents.
    }
    3.Render and Commit {
     * Two reason for component was render(initial render and state has been updated) .
     * createRoot was using for target the DOM Node(Nothing the HTML elements like tags <p>,<a>).
     * React will called as a root component as index.js.
    }
    4.SateAsSnapShort{
    *  State variables are we could read and wirte as javaScript Variables and How to re - render with the help of state
    Variables.
    * if we had to update the state by the varibles set in the state variables => state first thing !.
    * it was took as a previous values and set as the render the value again and agin as called re - render.
    }
   5.QueueingASeriesOfStateUpdates{
   *In this case We learn about how the  batches state was Updates .
   * we make a queue for the same state variables at the same time like we retrive a variable to map method as (a => a+1);
   * that function is called as updater function and it is used to update a function multiple time on one event .
   * An update function  added to the queue and it is must be pure only return the result .
   }
   6.UpdateTheObjectInState{
   * We can change the state object with the help of mutation Method and then in this method we could change the object vaule possible .
   * state is technically mutable but the state had been modified what we want to prefer.
   * if the state object was include already a nested object and i would be called by the object oriented of state.
   }
   6.UpdateArrayInState{
    * javaScript arrya also a mutable but in this topic we should try to make immutable for the state .
    * In this case we include some new keyWords for immutable array split syntax[...arrayName], slice,filter,map.
    *
