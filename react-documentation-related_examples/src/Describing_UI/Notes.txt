 4.PassingPropsToAComponent{
 * By using the props => properties in the jsx file it would be able to share the one parent Component variables to the
  child with the help of props .
  * we  create a constructor and pass some objects and values throught the render list this.state.values, but in the child
  components we share like given some variables to the objects  and then import the parent to the child and child to the parent class
  and just called the child class as this.props.variableName => we defined.
